# SMPC

This is a fork of SMPC to do some general cleanup and to introduce an new user interface which should better match the Sailfish user experience.

The code base is directly forked off https://github.com/fuchsmich/smpc which is derived from https://github.com/djselbeck/smpc who discontinued the support in july 2017.

This is a port of the symbian Qt/Qml Application qmobilempd. It uses the old c++ code and a new qml gui written especially for jolla.
